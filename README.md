While rich countries around the world have largely eliminated malaria and tuberculosis as public health threats, they continue to be major killers worldwide.  This project will let users visualize the disease burden from the "Big Three" infectious diseases (malaria, tuberculosis, HIV), as well as select neglected tropical diseases (trachoma, polio, and guinea worm).  Users will be able to compare different countries and see how these have changed over time.

This will be based on data from the WHO's GHO OData API

In Mapping Global Health, users will be able to:
-Look at the incidence and death rate of worldwode diseases including malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, trachoma, polio, and guinea worm
-See how these maps have shifted over time
-Choose between rates of disease cases/deaths and absolute numbers
-Compare disease burden with extreme poverty statistics (people living on ~$2/day)

In addition, this project will include (if time permits):
-Geolocated data for wild polio and guinea worm cases (there are under 100 worldwide per year)
-Buttons to toggle the language between English, Spanish, and French
-Filter using other criteria (e.g., death rate under-5 for malaria, tuberculosis death with/without HIV)# JavaScript-Project-Global-Health
